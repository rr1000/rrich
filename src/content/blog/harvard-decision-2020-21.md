### Thoughts:

When I first read that #Harvard would be forgoing full-time in person classes for the fall and 2021 my initial thoughts were:

How does this impact graduate programs like #MBA s, where arguably the most valuable component of the degree is nepotism and networking, both have hard requirements on in-person interaction;

...and two, how is #Harvard still able to justify a [[$50k+]]([https://college.harvard.edu/financial-aid/how-aid-works](https://college.harvard.edu/financial-aid/how-aid-works) tuition price tag. That seems absolutely insane to me. Not because I don't think students can learn online. I'm a big proponent of online education ([I co-founded an online training startup](https://www.haekka.com)), but because you go to Harvard for the #Networking. Not simply to gain an education.
