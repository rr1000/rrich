Everyone keeps saying AI levels the playing field. Junior devs can produce senior-level code now. Designers without training can make professional work. The gap is closing.

I don't think that's what's happening.

## What I actually see

AI multiplies whatever you already have. A senior engineer using Cursor or Claude can explore ten different architectures before lunch. They know which outputs smell wrong. They catch the subtle bugs that won't show up until prod. They're not just moving faster through the same work. They're doing work that wasn't possible before.

A junior engineer gets code that compiles and passes the obvious tests. They can't tell if the approach is going to be a maintenance nightmare in six months because they've never maintained anything for six months. More output, sure. Not more value.

## The multiplier changed

I used to think a strong senior was maybe 3x a junior. Mass generalization, but useful shorthand. With AI in the mix, it's closer to 10x. Maybe more.

Same pattern everywhere. A senior PM using AI can run customer research, positioning explorations, and strategy drafts in parallel. A junior PM gets prettier meeting notes.

## So what

If you're early in your career: AI isn't a shortcut. The judgment it requires is the judgment you haven't built yet. That part didn't change.

If you're senior: you're probably underselling what's possible. Using AI to go faster is fine. Using it to do things you couldn't do before is better.

If you're hiring: stop expecting AI to make green people productive. Start expecting your experienced people to produce way more. Budget accordingly.
